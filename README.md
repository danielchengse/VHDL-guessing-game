The program is a game written in VHDL for the Basys 3 FPGA board called Guessing Game. It is designed as a two-player
game, whereby the first player enters 16-bit hexadecimal digit, and the second player must guess
the exact number entered by the first player along with hints of “2 HI” or “2 LO” to assist the
second player.
